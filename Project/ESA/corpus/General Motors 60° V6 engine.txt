The General Motors 60° V6 engine family is a series of 60° V6 engines produced for both longitudinal and transverse applications. All of these engines are 12-valve cam-in-block or overhead valve engines, except for the LQ1; which uses 24 valves driven by dual overhead cams. These engines vary in displacement between 2.5 and 3.4 litres (2,490 and 3,350 cc) and have a cast-iron block and either cast-iron or aluminum heads. Production of these engines began in 1980 and ended in 2005 in the U.S., with production continued in China until 2010. This engine family was the basis for the GM High Value engine family. These engines have also been referred to as the X engines due to their first usage in the X-body cars.
This engine is not related to the GMC V6 engine that was designed for commercial vehicle usage.
This was the first GM "corporate engine" design not to have originated from a specific division.


== Generation I ==
The first generation of modern small GM 60° V6 engines featured an iron block and heads with inline valves. This "clean sheet" design was introduced in 1980 and versions were produced through 1995. Two different blocks with minor differences were developed:

A transverse engine family for front-wheel drive
A longitudinal engine family for rear-wheel drive


=== Transverse ===
The transverse engines began the 60° family in 1980. Like the rest of the Generation I engines, they were updated in 1985 with larger main journals for durability, along with multi-point fuel injection or E2SE carb and OBD I. Production of the Generation I transverse engines ended in 1986.


==== LE2 ====
The 2.8 L (2,837 cc) LE2 was the first version of the 60° engine. It was a transverse version produced from 1980 through 1986 for the A-body and X-body cars. The standard ("X-code") engine for this line, it used a two-barrel carburetor. Output was 115 hp (86 kW) for 1980 and '81 112 hp (84 kW) for 1982-86 and 135 lb⋅ft (183 N⋅m). Bore was 89 mm (3.5 in) and stroke was 76 mm (2.99 in).

=== Longitudinal ===
The longitudinal versions had minor differences from the transverse engines on which they were based. This group appeared in 1982 with the LC1 and LR2 and never added the aluminum heads of the Generation II engines.
Like the rest of the family, larger journals appeared in 1985, along with multiport fuel injection for the F-body LB8 version. TBI was added for the truck version in 1986.
A 3.1 L (3,135 cc) version was added in 1990 with an 8 mm (0.3 in) longer stroke (now 84mm), and a 3.4 L (3,350 cc) appeared for 1993 with a 92 mm (3.6 in) bore and SFI. Production of the 2.8 and 3.1 L (2,837 and 3,135 cc) (Isuzu) engines ended in 1994. Production ended for all longitudinal 60° V6s in 1996.

== Generation II ==
The second generation, still 2.8 litres (2,837 cc), was introduced in 1987. It used aluminum heads with splayed valves and an aluminum front cover. It was produced exclusively for transverse, front-wheel drive use. The next year, Chevrolet introduced a full-production long-stroke 3.1 L; 191.3 cu in (3,135 cc) version in the Pontiac 6000 STE AWD, with a 89 mm (3.5 in) bore and 84 mm (3.31 in) stroke compared to the 2.8 which shared the same bore, however with a 76 mm (2.99 in) in stroke. It was produced simultaneously with the 2.8 L (2,837 cc) in various compact and midsized vehicles until 1990, when the 2.8 L (2,837 cc) was dropped. MPFI was used on both, and a full-production turbo version was available on the 3.1 L (3,135 cc). An even higher displacement DOHC 3.4 L (3,350 cc) LQ1 was also developed, and eventually, the new GM High Value engine family followed. Production of OHV Generation II engines ended in 1994 after the introduction of the Generation III in 1993.

1992–1993 Chevrolet Lumina E85 VFV


=== LG5 ===
The LG5 ("V-code") was a special 3.1 L (3,135 cc) turbocharged engine produced with McLaren for the 1989 and 1990 model years. It featured the same multiport fuel injection intake manifolds and throttle body as the LH0, and produced 205 hp (153 kW) at 5200 rpm and 225 lb⋅ft (305 N⋅m) of torque at 2100 rpm.
Around 3,700 engines were produced each year. This engine had a block with more nickel content and hardened internals.
Applications:

1989–1990 Pontiac Grand Prix Turbo
1990 Pontiac Grand Prix Turbo STE


=== LQ1 ===

The LQ1 (also called the Twin Dual Cam or TDC) was a 3.4 L (3,350 cc) DOHC V6 engine ("X-code") based on the aluminum-headed second generation of GM's 60° engine line, sharing a similar block with its pushrod cousins, the 3.1 L LH0 V6 and the then recently retired 2.8 L (2,837 cc) LB6 V6. The engine was built only for front-wheel drive applications, and was featured exclusively in the first generation of GM's W-body platform.
It was built from 1991 to 1997. From 1991 to 1993, it used tuned multiport fuel injection, made 200–210 hp (149–157 kW) at 5200 rpm and 215 lb⋅ft (292 N⋅m) of torque at 4000 rpm. From 1994 to 1997, it used sequential port fuel injection, making 210 hp (157 kW) at 5200 rpm and 215 lb⋅ft (292 N⋅m) of torque at 4000 rpm. In 1996, the heads were redesigned for better flow, as well as now making the engine an interference design and adapting the engine for federally mandated OBDII emissions. Output for the 1996-1997 LQ1 is 215 hp (160 kW) and 220 lb⋅ft (298 N⋅m). It had four valves per cylinder. The 3.4 L (3,350 cc) engine substituted the standard camshaft for a chain driven intermediate shaft, which drives four overhead cams via a cogged belt. Adapting the 60°pushrod block for the LQ1's overhead cams significantly increased packaged engine height.
Bore was increased to 92 mm (3.6 in), and the 3.1 L (3,135 cc) engine's 84 mm (3.31 in) stroke was retained. Only a few interchangeable parts are use between this DOHC engine and other members of the 60° family, primarily the connecting rods and crankshaft.
The heads and intake manifolds were redesigned for the 1996 model year, incorporating a larger throttle body and plenum area, slightly longer intake runners, cloverleaf combustion chambers, and larger "pill"-shaped exhaust ports. Camshafts and cam timing were also revised for the new, higher-rpm powerband.
Optional from 1991 to 1993 was a Getrag 284 five-speed manual transaxle, which was also exclusive to the GM W platform and was available only with the LQ1. The electronically controlled Hydramatic 4T60-E four-speed automatic transaxle was the alternative, used during the entire production run with the exception of the 1997 Monte Carlo Z34 and 1997 Lumina LTZ, which received the 4T65-E.
Applications:

1991–1997 Chevrolet Lumina
1995–1997 Chevrolet Monte Carlo
1991–1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme
1991–1996 Pontiac Grand Prix


== Generation III ==
The third generation of the 60° engine was introduced in the 1993 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. Like its predecessors, it continued to use an overhead valve configuration with two valves per cylinder, a cast-iron cylinder block, aluminum cylinder heads, and an aluminum intake manifold. However, the heads and intake manifold were redesigned for better air flow, the cylinder block was stiffened, and the flat-tappets of the generation I and II engines were replaced with roller tappets. This generation also came standard with sequential multiport fuel injection and structural oil pan.


=== 3.1 L/3100 ===


==== L82 ====
The L82 ("M-code") was an updated, SFI replacement for the MPFI LH0, produced from 1993 through 1999. It featured a structural oil pan, a stiffer redesigned engine block, sequential fuel injection, and revised aluminum heads. Output for the L82 was up 20 hp (15 kW), over the previous Gen II LH0, to 160 hp (119 kW) at 5200 rpm and 185 lb⋅ft (251 N⋅m) at 4000 rpm. Compression ratio for the L82 was 9.5:1 and the bore measured 89 mm (3.5 in), while the stroke was 84 mm (3.31 in) giving it a displacement of 3.1 L; 191.3 cu in (3,135 cc).

==== LG8 ====

The LG8 ("J-code") was an updated version of the engine that displaced 3.1 L (3,135 cc). It still had an iron block and two-valve pushrod aluminum heads and full sequential port fuel injection. The LG8 also featured a new intake manifold and numerous changes to improve parts-sharing with the larger-displacement LA1 3400. Emissions were improved with secondary air injection and it earned LEV status. The engine featured a 89 mm (3.5 in) bore and a 84 mm (3.31 in) stroke and a 9.6:1 compression ratio. It produced 170–175 hp (127–130 kW) and 190–195 lb⋅ft (258–264 N⋅m). The LG8 was built in Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico and Tonawanda, New York.
